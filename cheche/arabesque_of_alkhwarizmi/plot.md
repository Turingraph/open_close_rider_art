# Plot

This story is intended to be the part of user tutorial of `arabesque_of_alkhwarizmi` (Linear Algebra visualization Python library, https://github.com/Turingraph/arabesque_of_alkhwarizmi)

I don't think about it yet, but it should be about Linear Algebra and it might be about
1.  The fictional plot about dimensional reduction algorithm, AI bias and the important of diverse perspective vs what should be focused in a limited time and space.
2.  Story similar to Flat Land where the protagonist try to figure out what higher dimensional geometric shape looks like.
3.  Story similar to Doctor Stone with some unrealistic fantasy but all about the practical application of Linear Algebra.
4.  The story similar to Imitation Game, about wars where the protagonist have to apply linear algebra and Error correction for communicating with their ally, protect their important data and/or for cyber-security related defence.
5.  The story that reflect how the characters interact with others in their live, similar to the symmetrical relationship between hypercube from n-d grids. Assassination Classroom already show the power of friendship symbolically in this mathematics in Fiction explaination video (https://youtu.be/64ZjFXrFBqE?si=KWwtXMzUqyBPQKWc)
6.  The story about multiverse where the protagonist who was adventurer meet him or her self in alternative universe because it turn out that the universe is Torus, Hypersphere or have other weird property. They also have the conversation about how them make differ decision in their life. This plot seem out of linear algebra theme the most, but I can connect it with linear algebra back with some help of group theory.
7.  Story about the normal life of quantum particles (try to convert quantum particles as non-scientific anthropomorphic fantasy fictional characters).
