# Plot

Open Close Rider is the story about post officer team help deliver data from messy text city to their post office in an open close manner .

What post officer team do ?
1.  Take the photo of text in messy text city
2.  Process the image
3.  Deliver text in organized Excel city

The theme of this story is all about OCR, Open Close Principle, typoglycemia and Synesthesia, and my personal experience with 
writing software both successfully and not successfully with HipHop vibe.

# Components

## Concrete Keyword (Main components)

1.  Open Close Principle
2.  OCR (box around the text)
3.  Typoglycemia
4.  Synesthesia
5.  Image processing algorithm visualization
6.  Pixel Art
7.  3B1B's Linear Algebra series
8.  Mirage
9.  HipHop
10. Text Street Art
11. Post Office
12. Internet 2000

## Inspiration (Supportive components)

1.  Musical Spirit (focus on Energetic and Rebelious Part)
-   Rock spirit (e.g. The Beatle, Nirvana, Weezer, The Strokes, Tally Hall etc)
-   Japanese Rock spirit (e.g. Zutomayo, Yonezu Kenshi, Bocchi the Rock etc)
-   HipHop spirit (e.g. Nujabes, A Tribe Called Quest, The Notorious B.I.G., Daft Punk etc)
2.  Shonen Energetic Spirit (focus on Energetic and Rebelious Part)
-   e.g. Sakamoto Day, Scott Pilgrim Take Off, Gintama, Cell at Work, Jojo Diamond is Unbreakable, Kamen Rider etc.
3.  Commercial Branding 
-   e.g. 7/11, Refactoring Guru, Nissin Noodle Cup, AWS, Window 7, Nintendo etc.
-   7/11, Nissin Noodle Cup and Refactoring Guru are the only 3 major commercial blanding inspiration to avoid be too similar to 
    game (Nintendo) and tech (AWS and Window 7), and for symbolize that 7/11 and similar industry need OCR technology.
4.  Post modernism art (but try to avoid minimalism)
-   e.g. Andy Warhol (fun fact, David wrote the song about him), Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow, Pop Art etc.
5.  Japanese UXUI.
-   The weird fact that Japanese Urban planning looks organized, but Japanese megazine and UXUI looks more messy than the weastern counterpart.

6.  Organized but not minimalistics, as Islamic and mathematical Art.

Note that things should be original for avoiding copyright issue.

## Text (Main components)

### Messy Text

Messy Text originated in Messy Text city and the Post Officer capture the photo of them.

What Messy Text looks like ?
1.  Characters in wrong order (typoglycemia)
2.  Characters might have differ size
3.  Feel more messy, but feel organized at the same time. Have implicite pattern.
4.  Rebelious HipHop
5.  Symbolized unprocess text.
6.  Have color but harder to read because it's color is similar (but don't too similar) 
    to background e.g. plant, rock, building etc as if they can camouflage with surrounding Urban environment.

### Organized Text

Organized Text originated by Post Officer processing the messy text.

What Organized Text looks like ?
1.  Characters in correct order
2.  Characters with same size
3.  Have explicite organized pattern e.g. 2D square Matrix, Inverse Matrix, Eigan Vector, Color based Determinant, Null Space etc.
4.  Organized but not minimalistic, beautiful as Islamic art.
5.  Symbolized processed text.
6.  Have color based on my synesthesia experience (e.g. A is red, B is Blue, C is yellow, D is organge yellow etc.)

## Setting (main components)

2000 liked normal city with lots of text and some (or all) town have text shape.

## Character (main components)

1.  Takeshi Tesseract
-   gender: male
-   music : guitar
-   tech  : Tesseract OCR
-   note  : Might look similar (but not identical) to Kenshi Yonezu.
2.  Oscar C. V.
-   gender: male
-   music : piano
-   tech  : Open CV
3.  Rebecca actress
-   gender: female
-   music : sing
-   tech  : React
4.  Typescript Writer
-   gender: male
-   music : drum
-   tech  : Typescript
-   note  : Wear the motorcycle helmet all the time and nobody know his face.
5.  Other minor characters (e.g. VSCode teams, AWS teams, GitHub users team, OCR users, Docker captain, SQL Dolphin pilot, PhP Elephant rider,
    the fictional version of my real life friends etc.) but try to avoid using exact logo and name for copyright concern.

# What to Show ? (Use Show, not tell technique)

## What to concept to show ?

1.  What is Open Close Principle and why does it matter ?
2.  Typoglycemia
3.  Synesthesia (text might have the same color as what color in text I see)
4.  Different Image Processing technique and OCR workflow

## Emotion

What it feel
1.  the messy text is Organized but Messy at the same time
2.  Nostalgia as 2000 video game and Pixel Art
3.  Fun, bold and rebellious as HipHop
4.  Refresh and energetic as Walking outdoor
5.  Cowboy vibe but without horse
6.  Some Urban green space, but no forest, mountain and sea.

What it not feel
1.  Sad, Depress as Radiohead and Tuyu
2.  Romance
3.  Weird and Mystery as Dandadan, SCP, detective story and some aspect of Jojo. No Ghost, Alien and SCP liked entity.
4.  Weird "Minimalistic" Nostalgia vibe as Backroom and Liminal Space
5.  Power of Friendship (it too cringe)
6.  Seriousness of Dystopia, political and social issue as 1984, the Matrix etc.
7.  Boring as minimalism, typical tech documentation and pure 3B1B's abstract minimalistic math visualization
8.  Sci fi as Doraemon, Digimon, Starwar, the Matrix, Startrek, Future is Wild, All Tomorrow and Man After Man
9.  Overpower Fighting as Shonen (e.g. My Hero Academia, One Punch Man, Sakamoto Day, Dragon Ball etc)
10. No Super Hero (with weird super hero custome e.g. Kamen Rider, Super man, Ultraman, The Mavel, DC,
    My Hero Academia, One Punch Man etc) but the OCR Post Office Rider (which inspired by Kamen Rider) more 
    similar to white blood cells from Cell at Work than Kamen Rider.
11. Too weird world building as Codex Seraphinianus.
12. A lots of Bezier curve similar to Celtic knot and Thai art
13. Minecraft 3D cube art style.
14. Asia Traditional Art

# Executable Plan

## To Do List

1.  3B1B's 2D Linear Algebra visualization based art pattern as the basis of text
-   Inverse Matrix, Null Space, fundamental theorem of subspace, SVD, Eigan Vector, null rank theorem etc. 
    but only focus on 2D vector space.
-   Use 2 matrixes per one image, because 2D Hexagon looks like 3D cube.
2.  Design Messy and/or Organized Text.
-   Messy and Organized text should have the same complexity but organized text should feel much more organized.
-   Try to make Messy Text feel both organized and messy at the same time.
-   Use typoglycemia in Messy Text
-   Use synesthesia in organized text.
-   Show interesting linear algebra related pattern in organized text explicitely and in messy text implicitly.
-   There should be clear visible distinction between messy and organized text.
4.  Mixing text with city (should city be 2D or 3D ?)
-   text Street Art
-   Town with the shape of text
-   Large text pop out of nowhere similar to some anime scene e.g. Kill la Kill, Scott Pilgrim Take Off, Dandadan, Spiderman into the Spiderverse etc.
-   Design Post Office building
5.  Open CV algorithm visualization drawing
-   Pixel Art
-   Otsu, Adaptive Threshold, Canny etc
6.  Post Officer and supportive Characters design
7.  Mix everythings from the `components` section, such that the vibe align with `Emotion` section and show the important of Open Close Principle. 
-   4 Officer Characters, other minor characters (e.g. VSCode teams, AWS teams, GitHub users team, OCR users etc)
-   text (with OCR box around text), messy text, organized text, 2D linear algebra visualization, 3D architecture perspective, 
    HipHop 
8.  Apply this artistic design with OCR tutorial, UXUI and short introduction storyboard.

## Things to mix, but no idea how to mix with text components ?

1.  How different Image Processing technique be visualized ?
-   Canny, Otsu, Convolution, Adaptive Gaussian Threshold etc.
2.  City and text ?
-   Sakamoto Day Op (https://youtu.be/1PuIWMuV-Ns?si=3GmIKr6sBnLXPj5_)
-   Large text pop out of nowhere similar to some anime scene e.g. Kill la Kill, Scott Pilgrim Take Off, Dandadan, Spiderman into the Spiderverse etc.
-   HipHop Art with lots of Text
3.  Mixing 2D linear algebra, image processing algorithm with Shonen HipHop inspiration.

## Other Questions

1.  How to show Open Close Principle through illustration without text ? Which body languages and characters should be in the same illustration
    to show the audience what Open Close Principle means ?
2.  How to make the messy text and organized text have the same "minimalism complexity level" yet make 
    organized text feel more organized than messy text, make the messy text feel organized yet messy at the same time and 
    make messy and organized text feel differ dramatically ?
3.  Should city be 2D or 3D ?
