# open_close_rider_art

The purpose of this repository is to contains concept art for our future OCR related tutorial,
UI decoration for `open_close_rider_app` (https://github.com/Turingraph/open_close_rider_app.git , 
which is OCR Desktop app). and for entertainment (many people already do comic, manga, animation 
and song based story telling so it is interesting to try doing UXUI and software documentation based 
story telling that balance practical usefulness and story telling).

This repository only contains `.md` files and artworks.

Anyone can also use my artwork as AI Art dataset as long as you don't make NFWS or inappropriate content
because in my opinion, the picture alone is just boring 5D rgb vector space where there is nothing new to create,
but it become much more interesting when using it in interesting context e.g. songs, comic, mathematical visualization,
UXUI etc.

Anyone can also contribute fanart and fan soundtrack in this repository.

This repository is empty and in development process.
