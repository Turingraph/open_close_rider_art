# Description

The purpose of this repository is to contains concept art for our future open source project related tutorial 
, UI decoration and for entertainment purpose (many people already do comic, manga, animation and song based 
story telling so it is interesting to try doing UXUI and software documentation based story telling that 
balance practical usefulness and story telling).

This repository only contains `.md` files, soundtrack, artworks and any other from of artworks.

Anyone can also use my artwork as AI Art dataset as long as you don't make NFWS or inappropriate content
because in my opinion, the picture alone is just boring 5D rgb vector space where there is nothing new to create,
but it become much more interesting when using it in interesting context e.g. songs, comic, mathematical visualization,
UXUI etc.

Anyone can create any original artworks, fanart (only about this repository to avoid copyright concern and be unique,
indirect reference e.g. fictional setting, inspiration, character with Song's name, AI art etc are allowed) 
and fan soundtrack in this repository as long as your content is appropriate and not violate copyright laws 
(AI generated content is allowed), by
1.  Git fork this repository
2.  Create sub directory with your unique name (my nick name is `cheche/`)
3.  Create the artworks and/or md file fictional plot in your directory
4.  Git commit and git push

The content can be about anythings (that appropriate and not violate copyright law), but it would be nice if it is about our open source repositories directly in the following list.
